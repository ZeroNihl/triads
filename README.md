## Cognicum

### Road Map

- [ ] General
    - [ ] Energy Based Continuous and Non Continuous Local Hopfield Hebbian Backprop Based Learning
    - [ ] Prevent Solution Space Sadel Points and Growing Plasticity Laziness (Search Term For It)
    - [ ] Better Local and Global Temporal and Dream Space Navigation
    - [ ] Merge Sparsely Managed Tensors and Classes Into a Single Class and Forward Where The Sparse Tensors Are Now Part of Large Tensor Chunks We Can Now Define Conditional Operation Branching on This Chunk For Reduced CPU and Improved GPU Usage
